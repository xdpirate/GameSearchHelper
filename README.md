# Game Search Helper
## About
Game Search Helper (GSH) is a userscript that runs on various gaming-related websites, and adds elements that let you search for games on external websites. As an example, when viewing a game on Steam, you can have buttons for searching Metacritic for that game, searching eBay for a physical copy, or a custom search engine to search your favorite review site.

## How to use
### Installation
1. Install a userscript manager addon such as Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey in your browser
1. Install the script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/441809-game-search-helper/) (click install button) or [Github](https://github.com/xdpirate/GameSearchHelper/raw/main/GameSearchHelper.user.js) (direct link)

### Configuration
After installation, navigate to a supported site (see below for an updated list). A small box with a magnifying glass will appear in the top-left corner of the page; Click it to expand the GSH options. The box will show the current context (site or groups of sites) you're in, and which search engines and options are enabled. Your enabled search engines are saved on a per-context basis, meaning you can have different enabled engines for different websites. Make your preferred changes, then press the "Save and reload" button to save your changes.

### Custom search engines
-  Starting with version 1.2, there are a number of custom search engines available for [one-click installation over at the CustomSearchEngines.md page!](https://github.com/xdpirate/GameSearchHelper/blob/main/CustomSearchEngines.md)

You can add any custom search engine you like to the script. To add a new custom search engine, press [new] in the upper-right corner of the custom search engine box within the options page. A new box will pop up beneath it. Fill in a display name, a search URL and an icon in the new text boxes, then click "Save and reload" to save your changes. Here's an explanation of the options:

#### **Display name**
The name of the custom search engine. This will show in the custom search engine list and when you hover over the resulting icon on the page

#### **Search URL**
The URL to use to search with this custom search engine. Substitute the search term (game name) with `%search%`. If you find that this doesn't work as expected, the website might expect spaces in searches to be replaced with plus-signs (+). In that case, substitute `%searchPlus%` instead.

#### **Icon**
A 16x16 image used to represent the custom search engine. This can be anything that's accepted in a html `<img>` tag's `src` attribute, like a direct URL to an image or an icon, or a [data URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) with the image contents itself. I recommend converting an image to a data URI, as that will make it load instantly, instead of having to make a new HTTP request for each icon to be loaded. You can use [Base64 Image Encoder](https://www.base64-image.de/) to easily convert an image into a data URI to paste into this field.

### Options
- **Open Startpage proxy results with one click**<br />
Amongst others, sites like OpenCritic have no proper search system to send a request to, only a JavaScript-based search on the site itself. GSH therefore uses Startpage to search OpenCritic, which requires you to click the top result to open the OpenCritic page. This option sends along a custom URL parameter to Startpage when performing that search, detects that parameter, and automatically clicks the top result for you. You can also manually add this parameter (`ocgsh=1`) to any other Startpage URL to achieve the same effect, in order to add other sites with no functioning GET-based search system.

- **Strip non-ASCII characters from search term**<br />
This option strips any non-ASCII character from the game name, such as &trade;, &copy;, &reg;, etc, in order to perform a clean search for the game name only. This *will* break searches for games with names containing non-latin script, such as Japanese. If you need search to work for games in languages with non-latin scripts, disable this option.

## Support, bug reports, or contributing
If you've found a bug, need help, would like to contribute code, or have any other concerns, please leave me some [feedback](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/441809-game-search-helper/feedback) on Greasy Fork, or create an [issue](https://github.com/xdpirate/GameSearchHelper/issues) in the Github repository.

## Backup
> There are two kinds of people: Those who do backups, and those who *will*.

As with any data you care about, I recommend you do regular backups of the script settings if you care about your custom search engines. I've tried to write the script in such a way that it should be resilient to future changes and additions, but unforeseen circumstances do occur. I am not a professional programmer, and only do it as a hobby, so no guarantee can be given as to code quality or actual resilience.

## History
GSH replaces three previous scripts of mine: 
- Steam Game Search Helper
- Hookshot Media Game Search Helper
- GSH OpenCritic Helper

If you installed any of these scripts previously, you can remove all of them, and replace them with this script, as it has all the features of the scripts it replaces.
